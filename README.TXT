*** ULTIMA IV: QUEST OF THE AVATAR ***

Â© 1985 by Lord British and Origin Systems, Inc.

To honor this classic work, now for the first time completely in the
German Language!

Based on xu4 with graphics and sound from the original Apple II version.

Version U4DEU-2023-12-22. Preliminary version, ONLY for testing, and as
they say, incomplet and incorrekt. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE OR UPLOAD ANYWHERE!!!

Needs pre-2020 Raspberry Pi (1,2,3 or old Zero). Does not yet run on any
later models!!

Since the game is in German and you will have a hard time enjoying it if
you don't understand that language, the rest of this README is in German too.
You can find it in the file !LIESDAS.TXT.

Enjoy! Finire Dragon (Linards Ticmanis)
